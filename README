This project is for you.  Fork the project, meet in the channel, discuss, modify and submit a pull request.
I'll merge in the requests and deploy the site to http://webdesign.hackinggibsons.com when I do, and automate it if it actually gets going.

I am by no means declaring myself BDFL on this project, so if someone is better, more interested or just plain cooler than me, let's talk.
